# DomeofPeace
This project aims to empower the couple through autonomous affordances over the environmentâ€™s behavior
so they can feel safe, relieve anxiety, and rebuild their trust with their surroundings.   
It is hoped that they can learn to build confidence in their relationship and express themselves in a comfortable environment.

We were given the story of Faye and Howard from the story "The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista" by JG Ballard.  
it is about a couple with relationship issues who are staying in a hotel while house-hunting and recovering from a traumatic experience in their previous home. 
Our solution was to create The Dome of Peace; a flexible, compact partition that separates the bed from the rest of the room. 
This partition allows the couple to have alone time when needed when they are fighting or involved in different tasks.
It also offers a comforting bubble where the couple can spend time together and recover from their recent experiences. 
We implemented an interface to control the position of the dome, allowing for the user to put the dome in several different modes. 
The interface utilized gold foil and capacitive touch sensors to operate one servo motor attached to a spool behind the dome.
